4. When ready, click the dark dot next to LoRA Detailers to turn it on and hit generate.
5. Celebrate!

### Note
- This workflow does not include my personal LoRAs and they're not accessible.  You have to find your own character LoRAs, there are plenty around.
- You will likely have to adjust settings depending on your image.  This just gets you to the point where you can do that!
